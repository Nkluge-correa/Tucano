## Dataset Description

- **Repository:** https://huggingface.co/datasets/TucanoBR/GigaVerbo-Text-Filter

### Dataset Summary

GigaVerbo Text-Filter is a dataset with 110,000 randomly selected samples from 9 subsets of [GigaVerbo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TucanoBR/GigaVerbo) (i.e., specifically those that were not synthetic). This dataset was used to train the text-quality filters described in "_[Tucano: Advancing Neural Text Generation for Portuguese](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx)_". To create the text embeddings, we used [sentence-transformers/LaBSE](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/LaBSE). All scores were generated by GPT-4o.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

This dataset can be utilized for tasks involving text classification/regression in Portuguese.

### Languages

Portuguese

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

The dataset consists of the following features:

- **text:** a string of text in Portuguese.
- **score:** the score attributed by GPT-4o to that corresponding string of text.
- **embedding:** embedding vector generated by [sentence-transformers/LaBSE](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/LaBSE) to that corresponding string of text.
- **name:** the subset of GigaVerbo from which the corresponding text string originated.

### Data Fields

```python
{
  "text": "A inteligência artificial (de sigla: IA; do inglês: artificial intelligence, de sigla: AI) é um campo de estudo multidisciplinar que abrange varias áreas do conhecimento ...",
  "score": 0.85,
  "embedding": [0.313, 0.716, 0.897, 0.571, 0.061, 0.712, 0.265, 0.092, 0.816, 0.998, ...],
  "name" : "brwac"
}
```

### Data Splits

Available splits are `train`.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("TucanoBR/GigaVerbo-Text-Filter", split='train')

# If you don't want to download the entire dataset, set streaming to `True`
dataset = load_dataset("TucanoBR/GigaVerbo-Text-Filter", split='train', streaming=True)

```

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

This dataset was developed as part of the study "[Tucano: Advancing Neural Text Generation for Portuguese](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx)". In short, GigaVerbo Text-Filter is a dataset with 110,000 randomly selected samples from 9 subsets of [GigaVerbo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TucanoBR/GigaVerbo).

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

GigaVerbo Text-Filter has been scored GPT-4o. Text embeddings were generated by [sentence-transformers/LaBSE](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/LaBSE).

#### Who are the source language producers?

All text samples are native to Portuguese or translated from other languages to Portuguese (slight contamination of different languages should also be expected).

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

GigaVerbo Text-Filter is a dataset with 110,000 randomly selected samples from 9 subsets of [GigaVerbo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TucanoBR/GigaVerbo). All text samples are native to Portuguese or translated from other languages to Portuguese (slight contamination of different languages should also be expected).

#### Who are the annotators?

### Personal and Sensitive Information

This dataset can potentially contain personal and sensitive information, along with offensive, toxic, and disturbing language.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

The presence of personal and sensitive information within the dataset raises concerns about privacy and data protection, potentially leading to breaches of individuals' confidentiality and security. Furthermore, the inclusion of offensive, toxic, and disturbing language in the dataset poses risks of perpetuating harmful behaviors and attitudes, contributing to the normalization of hate speech and online toxicity. Therefore, careful handling and ethical considerations are essential to mitigate these potential social impacts and promote responsible dataset use.

### Discussion of Biases

The inclusion of offensive, toxic, and disturbing language in the dataset poses risks of perpetuating harmful behaviors and attitudes, contributing to the normalization of hate speech and online toxicity.

### Other Known Limitations

A significant portion of the dataset's data has been translated using translation engines, potentially resulting in corrupted samples of both language and code. While useful for quickly converting text between languages, translation engines often struggle with accurately preserving the syntax, semantics, and context of programming languages. As a result, the translated code may contain errors, syntax inconsistencies, or even introduce vulnerabilities, rendering it unreliable or unusable for its intended purpose.
